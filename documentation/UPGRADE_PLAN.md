  10. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

  - All external APIs recommended are FREE for your scale
  - No additional database schema changes needed (use existing
  EnhancedActivity fields)
  - Weather data: cache by date+location to minimize API calls
  - VO2 Max: calculate async, cache for 7 days
  - Benchmarking: run as background job nightly
  - Race data: update weekly via cron

⏺ ---
  Summary

  You have a strong foundation with comprehensive Strava data, but are
  missing critical metrics that competitors use (VO2 max, training load,
  sleep/HRV, weather context).

  Quick wins include adding Weather Context, VO2 Max Estimation, and
  Training Load agents using your existing data and free public APIs.

  Unique differentiation opportunities lie in Social Benchmarking, Race
  Recommendations, and Terrain-Aware planning - features no competitor
  offers comprehensively.

  With ~2 months of development, you can build a coaching platform that
  combines the best of Strava's data richness, WHOOP's AI coaching, and
  Garmin's adaptive planning - while offering unique features they don't
  have.
